## 💬 Sample Bot Replies (Based on What You Type)

- hi / hello    --             Hey bestie! 💖 How can I help you today?/
- how are you	  --             I'm doing amazing! Hope you're feeling great 😊/
- help / support	 --          I'm here for you! What do you need help with? 💬/
- anything else	   --          You said: "<your message>". I'm just a simple support bot 💼

**Note❗**: I originally intended to integrate OpenAI's API to power the chatbot’s responses. However, due to quota limitations on the API key, I proceeded with a logic-based mock chatbot to demonstrate the proof of concept.
